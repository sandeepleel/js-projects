🕰️ Just Built a Real-Time Analog Clock Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript!

Excited to share one of my latest frontend mini-projects — a fully functional analog clock built from scratch using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🎯

🔧 What I Learned:

DOM manipulation for real-time updates

CSS transforms & custom properties for animation

Handling time logic in JavaScript

Clean and responsive UI design principles

💡 Why this project?
Because even small projects like these help sharpen your understanding of how things move and interact in the DOM. Plus, it's always satisfying to bring something to life from code!

📌 Open to feedback, suggestions, or ideas on how I can improve it further!

Let’s keep building and learning together. 💻✨
